### Resume
Hello everyone, this is a project created by me (Linkyed) and my friend Nalbert(Nalbertsan), this project was created to be a "simulator" of the Futbool World Cup
where the user can create his own teams, choachs, players and referees, or use a preset of all the real teams to make the simulation. After that the program will generate
all the matchs with the 32 teams and the user will have to decide who wins the match, who marked goals, who gets yellow and red cards and some other things. After
that the program will have calculate who is the first and second place of each group, and with that the play-offs will start with round of 16 until reach the 
final match, in all matchs the user is that decide who wins even if the match go to the penalty shootout.

### Our Work
In the first months me (Linkyed) and my friend started with the Objects of the program and the DAO's, making all of them, with methods and variables, in this part
we only have the teams, coaches, players and referees to create, so we focused on create theirs DAO's. After we create all this things, we started to develope the logical
sequence for the user can use all the program funcionalities, since it was the start of the project we only made a simple main with all the actions in the program
showed in the console to the user can chose with a number who represent a option.

After that we started with the matches and groups, followind the same order that we used to create the first objects, first creating the object and after creating
the DAO. The mathc was really easy to create, we only get all the teams of each group and with that the program can generate all the mathcs, the user only needs
to fill the result of the match, who marked the goal and other little things. Then after the user decided the result of a match, the program will calculate the
position of all the teams of the group and it will organize who is in the first, second, third and fourth place based on teams points. In the final time of this
part we created a search system, who the user can type a name, or a part of the name and can search for a person(Players, Choaches and referees), a full team or
with an date it can search for all the matchs that happened in the day.

Now in the final stage of the program, we are developing the play-off of the Wordl Cup, whit the Round of 16, quarterfinals, Semi-finals and the final, and the 
graphic interface. For that we started again with the logical part, making all the things work first on the console, and after that we started with th interface.
For now we only have the main menu, with two options who the user can chose to create all the teams, players, coachs e referees or the user can use the preseted
teams of the real world cup, in the both parts the user can edit a team, choach or a player or can delet one of this things too. After 32 completed teams was
created, then the program will go to the part of the matches, group stage and play-offs
